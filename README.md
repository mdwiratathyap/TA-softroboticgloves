# TA-softroboticgloves

This is source code for [this undergraduate thesis](https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/view/83637). In this 2024 version, we have optimized the pressure and angle control of the soft robotic gloves that we have tested only for one finger. The 2023 version is for the previous version which can actuated all fingers independently like stated in this [this undergraduate thesis](https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/view/74575/).
